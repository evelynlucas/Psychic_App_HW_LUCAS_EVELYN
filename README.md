# Spooky Psychic App
Prepare to get spooked! This app allows you to choose from three horror themes and then to guess if the image you choose matches against the computer's choice.

Pull-down menu to choose from themes:

Hope you don't scare easily! Here is a sample of two of the horror themes:

And here are the two possible responses from choosing an image. The percentage will change according to how many times you play the game:

Hope you enjoy! And have fun! ðŸ’€
